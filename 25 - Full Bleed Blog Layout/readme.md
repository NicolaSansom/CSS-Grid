# Lessons learnt

It may have taken me awhile but I made it to the final video in the CSS grid series ðŸŽŠ

This one is covered blog layouts. To showcase laying out primarily just text

## Positioning items within a grid

This video was  a loop over what we had already learnt so far in the series. One thing I enjoyed going over the how spanning of columns worked

To span the full length of a grid

```css
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
```

To span one column of a grid

```css
    grid-column: 1 / span 1;
```

To span the right hand column of the a grid

```css
    grid-column: 3 / -1;
```
